    <h2>Seeing the World Differently</h2>
    <p>
    Art is the way that one does a thing. 
    It is that practice of presence together with the intent of simplifying what is complex and
    perhaps even utimatley unknowable.     </p>



    <h2>Process and Practice</h2>
    <p>My process is rooted in observation and play. I sketch daily, exploring compositions and rhythms before moving into paint. I value the balance between control and letting the materials guide the work, allowing drips, dry brush, and layered colors to form a conversation on the surface.</p>

    <h2>Why I Create</h2>
    <p>I create because it helps me understand and appreciate the world. It is a form of meditation, a way to communicate without words, and a practice that keeps me present. Through my art, I hope to offer viewers moments of quiet reflection and connection with the small beauties around us.</p>
